# Formats the customers & invalid lines for output
# I decided to keep these within one class, rather than as methods on the
# model objects, because:
# 1. it's one concern (formatting for output)
# 2. I like to keep models thin, and free of presentation code
# 3. I like to keep the .to_s methods on models working as expected
#   (i.e. an inspection of the model's attributes)
# There's always exceptions to the above rules, of course, they're more
# like rules-of-thumb. I think they hold in this case, but quite happy to
#Â be persuaded otherwise.
